<h1>Describe Datasets</h1>

<p>Welcome to my application! I manage a collection of books, short stories, and villains.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attributes: Title, Year, Pages</li>
  <li>Associations: Linked to various villains</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shorts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attributes: Title, Type, Handle, Year</li>
  <li>Associations: Linked to various villains</li>
</ul>

<h3>Villains</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attributes: Name, Gender, Status</li>
  <li>Associations: Associated with both books and shorts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Integration and Relationships</h3>
<ul>
<li>Books and Villains: Establish a many-to-many relationship using a join table (book_villains). This table will connect books and villains based on their IDs, allowing each book to have multiple villains and vice versa.</li>
<li>Shorts and Villains: Similarly, establish a many-to-many relationship using another join table (shorts_villains). This table will connect shorts and villains, enabling each short story to have multiple villains and each villain to appear in multiple short stories.</li>
<li>Integration: Utilize unique identifiers (IDs or URLs) provided by each API to link data across different tables. For example, link villains to specific books and shorts based on the URLs or IDs provided in the API responses.</li>
<p>By structuring the database with these tables and relationships, we can effectively store and manage data about books, villains, and shorts from external sources while ensuring the flexibility to query and display relationships between these entities in our application.
